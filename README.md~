# Apex Simulator
This project helps to implement a cycle-by-cycle simulator for an out-of-order APEX pipeline.
It also has a forwarding mechanism for handling dependency. 
I have added the test input file with isnstructions. 


When we run the project, we get the below options -

 Simulator 

		1) Initialize   //Initializes all the Registers
		2) simulate:    // Number of cycles you want to simulate
		3) Display Memory Locations    // The Memory address values
		4) Exit        // Exit the program
